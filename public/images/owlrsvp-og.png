<!-- This is a placeholder. In a real scenario, you would need to create an actual PNG image file. 
Since we can't create binary files through this interface, you would need to create this image separately using a design tool like Photoshop, Figma, etc.

The OpenGraph image should be:
- 1200x630px for optimal display on social media
- Include the OwlRSVP logo with neon effect
- Have a dark background with cyberpunk elements
- Include a tagline like "Beautiful Event RSVP Management"
- Use the neon color scheme (blue, pink, green) from the site
